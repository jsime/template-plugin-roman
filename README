NAME
    Template::Plugin::Roman - Filter for converting Arabic numerals to Roman

VERSION
    Version 1.0

SYNOPSIS
    This module provides a Template::Toolkit filter plugin for converting
    Arabic numerals into Roman. The actual conversion is performed by
    Math::Roman. The same restrictions imposed by that module are in effect
    here (4499 is the largest "real" Roman number - everything after that
    will simply have too many 'M's).

    Using the filter is straightforward (assume that your controller has
    placed "(localtime)[5]" in a stash key called "current_year"):

        [% USE Roman %]

        The year is [% current_year | roman %].

METHODS
  init
    Initialize filter object.

  filter
    Implement filter.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
