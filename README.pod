=head1 NAME

Template::Plugin::Roman - Filter for converting Arabic numerals to Roman

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module provides a Template::Toolkit filter plugin for converting Arabic
numerals into Roman. The actual conversion is performed by Math::Roman. The
same restrictions imposed by that module are in effect here (4499 is the largest
"real" Roman number - everything after that will simply have too many 'M's).

Using the filter is straightforward (assume that your controller has placed
C<(localtime)[5]> in a stash key called C<current_year>):

    [% USE Roman %]

    The year is [% current_year | roman %].

=head1 METHODS

=head2 init
